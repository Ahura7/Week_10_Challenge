#### Answer the following question: What is the best value for k?
**Question:** What is the best value for `k`?

**Answer:**

*Based on the Diagram above the best k is 4 as the break in the line, aka elbow, is most pronounced.*

#### Answer the following question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

**Question:** What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

**Answer:** 

*The total explained variance, i.e. sum of the the 3 components, is 89.5%. This means 89.5% of the variance in the data can be explained using the indentified features and the rest of the features are dropped.*

#### Answer the following questions: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data? Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
* **Question:** What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?

   * **Answer:**
      *Based on the Diagram above the best k is 4 as the break in the line, aka elbow, is most pronounced.*


* **Question:** Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

  * **Answer:**
      *The k value found matches the one found using the original data*
      
      
#### Answer the following question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  * **Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  * **Answer:** *Using fewer features, results in cleaner clustering of the data and a better visualisation.*
